## Development Best Practices

### Before Starting Each Phase
1. Review `PROJECT_VISION.md` to align with goals
2. Create a new git branch for the phase
3. Update todo list with phase tasks
4. Set up local development environment

### During Development
1. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
2. Test locally before deploying
3. Update documentation as you build
4. Keep `CURRENT_STATUS.md` up to date
5. Stick to the defined scope - avoid feature creep

### After Completing Each Phase
1. Test all features end-to-end
2. Deploy to production
3. Create checkpoint tag (WORKING3, WORKING4, etc.)
4. Update status documentation
5. Review and plan next phase

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Start new phase
git checkout -b phase-1-react-frontend

# During development
git add <files>
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

# Before deploying
git checkout main
git merge phase-1-react-frontend

# Create checkpoint
git tag WORKING3
git push origin main --tags
```

## Notes & Decisions Log

### 2025-10-11: Technology Decisions
- **Frontend:** React (chosen for flexibility and ecosystem)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (rapid development, professional look)
- **Deployment:** Serve from Spring Boot (simpler than separate deployments)
- **AI Provider:** Claude API or OpenAI (TBD based on requirements)

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Product search and discovery
- AI chat for sales/support
- Analytics and reporting
- Market discount tracking

**Out of Scope (for now):**
- User authentication
- Multi-store management
- Mobile apps
- Third-party integrations
- Payment processing

**Future Considerations:**
- Caching layer (Redis)
- Advanced analytics (ML models)
- Voice interface
- Mobile apps
