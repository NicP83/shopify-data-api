- Avoid feature creep
- Document all new ideas but implement later
- Reference this vision document before adding features

### 3. User-Centric Design
- Build for customer service representatives first
- Prioritize ease of use over complexity
- Fast response times and reliability
- Clear error messages and guidance

### 4. Production-Ready Code
