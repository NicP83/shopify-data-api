# WORKING2 Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Checkpoint:** Product URLs and Cart Permalink functionality added
**Previous Checkpoint:** WORKING1 (all 13 endpoints functional)

## What's New in WORKING2

### Product URL & Cart Functionality ✅

Successfully enhanced the API with product linking and "add to cart" capabilities.

#### 1. Product URLs in API Responses
- Added `onlineStoreUrl` field to all product GraphQL queries
- Available in: `searchProducts()`, `getProducts()`, `getProductById()`
- Shopify provides this URL for active products (returns null for archived products)
- Can use product `handle` to construct URLs when needed

#### 2. Cart Permalink Support
Added utility methods to `ShopifyConfig.java` for URL construction:

**File:** `src/main/java/com/shopify/api/config/ShopifyConfig.java`

```java
// Constructs product page URL
public String getProductUrl(String handle)
// Returns: https://hearnshobbies.myshopify.com/products/{handle}

// Constructs "add to cart" permalink
public String getAddToCartUrl(String variantId, int quantity)
// Returns: https://hearnshobbies.myshopify.com/cart/{variantId}:{quantity}

// Default quantity of 1
public String getAddToCartUrl(String variantId)
```

#### 3. How Cart Permalinks Work

Instead of complex API mutations, Shopify supports simple cart URLs:
```
https://hearnshobbies.myshopify.com/cart/{variantId}:{quantity}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Works from anywhere (email, SMS, chat, websites)
- No authentication needed
- Customer clicks → item in cart → ready to checkout
- Perfect for customer service use cases

### Files Modified

2. **ShopifyConfig.java** - Added 3 utility methods:
