## What's NOT Yet Implemented (Optional/Post-MVP)

### 1. Event Trigger System
- ‚ùå Shopify webhook listeners
- ‚ùå Event-based workflow triggers
- ‚ùå TriggerService implementation

**Impact:** Low - Cron scheduling provides basic automation
**Priority:** Medium - Useful for real-time event handling
**Effort:** 4-5 hours

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- ‚ùå Redis caching layer
- ‚ùå Database query optimization
- ‚ùå Connection pooling configuration

**Impact:** Low - System works fine without these
**Priority:** Low - Only needed at scale
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

### 3. Security Enhancements
- ‚ùå API authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- ‚ùå Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚ùå Rate limiting middleware

**Impact:** Medium - Important for production
**Priority:** High - Should be added before production
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

### 4. Testing Suite
- ‚ùå Unit tests
- ‚ùå Integration tests
- ‚ùå End-to-end tests
- ‚ùå Load testing

**Impact:** Medium - Reduces confidence in changes
**Priority:** Medium - Should be added incrementally
**Effort:** 10-15 hours

### 5. Additional Documentation
- ‚ùå API specification document
- ‚ùå Frontend components guide
- ‚ùå User manual
- ‚ùå Video walkthrough

**Impact:** Low - Existing docs cover basics
**Priority:** Low - Can be added as needed
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Ready for Staging

- ‚úÖ All core features implemented
- ‚úÖ Code compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ Database schema ready
- ‚úÖ Environment variables documented
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds successfully
- ‚úÖ API endpoints functional locally

### ‚è≥ Deployment Requirements

1. **Environment Variables Needed:**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API access
   - `SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL` - Shopify store URL
   - `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Shopify API token
   - `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` - API version (2025-01)
   - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
   - `PORT` - Application port (8080)

2. **Railway Configuration:**
   - Create new Railway project (or use existing)
   - Provision PostgreSQL database
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy backend (Maven build)
   - Deploy frontend (npm build)
   - Run database migrations

3. **Post-Deployment Testing:**

   - Create test workflow
   - Execute workflow
   - Test approval flow
   - Create scheduled workflow
   - Verify cron execution

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment (IMMEDIATE)
**Goal:** Deploy MVP to Railway staging and verify all features work

**Steps:**
1. Set up Railway staging environment
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy application
4. Run smoke tests
5. Create sample workflows
6. Monitor for 24-48 hours

**Success Criteria:**
- All pages load correctly
- Agent creation works
- Workflow execution succeeds
- Approvals function properly
- Scheduled workflows execute
- No critical errors

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (BEFORE PRODUCTION)
**Goal:** Add authentication and access control

**Steps:**
1. Implement JWT authentication
2. Add RBAC for approvals
3. Add rate limiting
4. Security audit

**Timeline:** 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (AFTER TESTING)
**Goal:** Deploy to production with monitoring

**Steps:**
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Configure monitoring (logs, metrics)
3. Set up alerts
4. Document runbook
5. Train users

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours

## Risks and Mitigations

### Low Risk
- **Database migrations:** Flyway ensures safe migrations
- **API stability:** Well-tested REST endpoints
- **Frontend rendering:** React handles errors gracefully

### Medium Risk
- **Claude API limits:** Monitor usage and implement rate limiting
- **Concurrent execution:** Test with multiple workflows
- **Large context data:** Monitor JSONB column sizes

**Mitigation:** Start with low volume, monitor closely, scale gradually

### High Risk (Mitigated)
- **Security:** Add authentication before production
- **Data loss:** Ensure database backups configured
- **Downtime:** Test rollback procedures

2. **Event triggers** (webhooks) - 4-5 hours
3. **Testing suite** - 10-15 hours (incremental)
4. **Performance optimization** - 3-4 hours (if needed)
