- Supports: `${variable}==value`, `${variable}!=value`, `!${variable}`
- Nested path resolution: `${trigger.userId}`, `${step1.result.status}`
- Boolean checks with null safety

#### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

- Automatic backoff calculation: `delay = min(initial * multiplier^attempt, maxDelay)`
- Seamless workflow continuation after successful retry

#### Parallel Execution Support
- `executeStepsInParallel()` method for concurrent agent execution
- Individual step error handling (doesn't fail entire group)
- Result aggregation with output variable mapping
