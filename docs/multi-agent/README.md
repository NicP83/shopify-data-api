## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers Starting Implementation

1. **Read the docs in this order**:
   ```
   1. README.md (this file)
   2. ARCHITECTURE.md
   3. DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
   4. IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
   ```

2. **Check current progress**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/multi-agent/PROGRESS.md
   ```

3. **Start Phase 1** (Database & Entities):
   ```bash
   # Copy SQL from DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
   # Create migration file:
   # src/main/resources/db/migration/V002__multi_agent_system.sql
   ```

4. **Follow the roadmap sequentially**:
   - Don't skip phases
   - Test after each phase
   - Update PROGRESS.md

### For Claude (AI Assistant)

When continuing this project in future sessions:

1. **Load context**:
   ```
   "Look at docs/multi-agent/PROGRESS.md to see current status"
   "Reference docs/multi-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md for system design"
   "Check docs/multi-agent/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md for next steps"
   ```

2. **Resume work**:
   - Check PROGRESS.md for current phase
   - Reference relevant documentation
   - Update PROGRESS.md after completing tasks

3. **Avoid context loss**:
   - All architecture decisions documented
   - All database specs saved
   - All implementation steps planned
   - Progress tracked in PROGRESS.md

## System Summary

### What We're Building

A **database-driven multi-agent orchestration system** that:
- Lets you create AI agents via UI (no coding required)
- Chain agents together in visual workflows
- Support conditional logic and branching
- Pause for human approvals
- Run on schedules or triggered by events
- Track all executions with detailed logs

### Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.2
- PostgreSQL (10 tables)
- Spring WebFlux (reactive)
- Claude/GPT/Gemini APIs

**Frontend**:
- React 18
- React Flow (visual workflow builder)
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

**Deployment**:
- Railway (staging & production)
- Separate databases per environment

### Zero Hardcoding Principle

**Everything** is defined in the database:
- Agent types (no Java classes for specific agents)
- Tool registry (dynamically loaded)
- Workflows (JSON configurations)
- Conditions (evaluated at runtime)

Example: To create a new agent type, you just add a database record. No code changes needed.

## Key Concepts

### Agents
- Database records defining AI personalities
- Configurable: model, prompt, temperature, tools
- Reusable across workflows
- Example: "Product Expert", "Customer Support", "Order Processor"

### Tools
- Capabilities agents can use
- Registered in database
- Dynamically assigned to agents
- Example: product_search, order_lookup, send_email

### Workflows
- Sequences of agent executions
- Conditional branching
- Human approvals
- Triggered manually, on schedule, or by events

### Context
- Shared data structure passed between agents
- Each agent adds its output
- Next agents access previous results
- Example: `${step1.sentiment}` references first agent's output

## Database Overview

### 10 Core Tables

1. **`agents`** - Agent definitions
2. **`tools`** - Tool registry
3. **`agent_tools`** - Agent-tool assignments (many-to-many)
4. **`workflows`** - Workflow definitions
5. **`workflow_steps`** - Steps within workflows
6. **`workflow_executions`** - Execution tracking
7. **`agent_executions`** - Individual agent runs
8. **`approval_requests`** - Human approval tracking
9. **`knowledge_bases`** - RAG content per agent
10. **`workflow_schedules`** - Cron schedules

**Size Estimate**: ~400MB for 10,000 executions

---

## Implementation Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Documentation (70% complete)

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete remaining documentation
2. Create SQL migration file
3. Generate JPA entities
4. Test database schema

**Estimated Total Time**: 76-97 hours (2-3 weeks)

See [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) for detailed status.

## Decision Log

Key architectural decisions:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| PostgreSQL JSONB for config | Flexibility without schema changes |
| Single-phase implementation | User preference for complete system |
| Railway for deployment | Existing infrastructure, easy staging |
| React Flow for visual builder | Industry standard, well-maintained |
| Zero hardcoding | Maximum flexibility, no code changes for new agents |
